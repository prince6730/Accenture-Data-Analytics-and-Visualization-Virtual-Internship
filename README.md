# Accenture-Data-Analytics-and-Visualization-Virtual-Internship

Task 1: Project Understanding

Read the brief from Social Buzz
Your first task is to read the brief from Social Buzz and complete a short knowledge check before the call. 

One of Accenture’s Managing Directors, Mae Mulligan, is the client lead for Social Buzz.
She has reviewed the brief provided by Social Buzz and has assembled a diverse team of Accenture experts to deliver the project.
Mae has scheduled a project kick off call with the internal Accenture project team for tomorrow morning.
Ahead of the call, Mae has shared the project brief so you can get up to speed on what Social Buzz need help with.

Read the brief to:

Understand the client and business problem at hand.
Identify the requirements that need to be delivered for this project.
Identify which tasks you should focus on as a Data Analyst.

Complete the knowledge check to move onto the next step. You can attempt each question in the knowledge check as many times as you like!


Task 2: Data Cleaning & Modeling

Let's dive into the data

Now you have a good understanding of the project and your role - it’s time to get to work!
Don’t worry if you haven’t done data analysis before, we’ll take you through each step and provide support along the way.
So, let’s have a look at what data you have to work with. The client has sent through:

- 7 data sets - each data set contains different columns and values
- A data model - this shows the relationships between all of the data sets, as well as any links that you can use to merge tables.
- 
There is a lot of information here and it’s easy to get lost in the data. So, to make sure you are using the right data to answer the business questions you’ll follow these steps:

1. Requirements gathering
2. Data cleaning
3. Data modelling


1. Requirements gathering:-

As we mentioned, you have been sent 7 datasets and a data model.

Often you won’t need all these datasets to find what you’re looking for.

So, the first step is to use this data model to identify which datasets will be required to answer your business question - which is to to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.

When you think you’ve identified the right data sets to include, complete the multi choice quiz to move onto the next step.

2. Data cleaning:- 

Data cleaning is a common and very important task when working with data.
What you need to do:
First: Open the three data sets below

Second: Clean the data by:

- removing rows that have values which are missing,
- changing the data type of some values within a column, and
- removing columns which are not relevant to this task.
      -  Think about how each column might be relevant to the business question you’re investigating. If you can’t think of why a column may be useful, it may not be worth including it.
 
Your end result should be three cleaned data sets. 


3. Data modelling:- 

Now we want to figure out the top 5 categories. To complete your data modelling, follow these steps:

1. Create a final data set by merging your three tables together

-  We recommend using the Reaction table as your base table, then first join the relevant columns from your Content data set, and then the Reaction Types data set.
- Hint: You can use a “VLookUp” formula
 
2. Figure out the Top 5 performing categories

- Add up the total scores for each category.
- Hint: You can use the “Sum If” formula

The end result should be one spreadsheet which contains:

1. A cleaned dataset
2. The top 5 categories
 
Once you have a final data file, upload it to complete this task! We'll provide you with some explanation videos in the next step - but first give it a go to see if you can figure it out. 

You can use Excel or any other tool of your choice to create your final data set.


Task 3: Data Visualization & Storytelling


Build your presentation Structure
Importantly, before you start creating your data charts, you should plan your presentation structure. This will ensure your presentation answers the right questions.

Here is a template that we would use at Accenture to create a presentation. You need to download this template and populate slides 2-6.

Great work! To ensure you're on the right track, have a look at these annotated images to see how a professional at Accenture would have completed slides 2-6. 

Notice how the information is clear and concise, and summarizes the most important points. You can click on each image to expand it.

When you're done, move onto the next step and we'll add in some charts!  

Create your charts
The final step of this task is to populate slides 7 - 10 with your data insights.

If you’ve lost your spreadsheet, we’ve attached one here again for you to use.

We know that the client wants to understand the top 5 content categories. Have a think about what are the best ways to present this? In a pie chart? In a bar chart?

There are also some other interesting insights that we might want to share with them. For example:

- How many unique categories are there?
- How many reactions are there to the most popular category?
- What was the month with the most posts?


Task 4: Present to the Client:-


1. When presenting to the client there are a few things that you should remember:

2. They may not all be familiar with data, so you need to make sure you talk to them in business-friendly language.
 
3. You want to show them that you’ve understood their business and requirements, so use their terminology and language relevant to the task.
 
4. This is your time to shine and to show them how great you are! Try to present your work with confidence and conviction, if you don’t feel confident talking about your results then it’s a good indication that you don’t understand them fully or may need to revisit the dataset! Speaking about your results should feel natural when you explain what you’ve done.
 
5. A good presentation always takes a lot of preparation. The more you practice presenting your content, the more confident you will be when the time comes. Practice with your housemates, friends, family, anyone that is free! Ask for feedback and keep improving until you’re happy with your presentation and you’re confident in presenting your content.
